# Success Web

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Our team, BBY-40 is developing a study support app to promote
equity by empowering students at a higher risk of dropping out due to
socioeconomic status, race, and academic performance.</p>

<h1>Technologies</h1>
<p>In the development of SuccessWeb, we used a range of technologies to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience. For the front-end design, we utilized <b style="color:cyan">JavaScript</b>,  <b style="color:red">EJS</b>, <b style="color:cyan">HTML</b>, and <b style="color:cyan">CSS</b>, and <b style="color:cyan">DALL-E</b> for images creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.</p>

On the back-end, we leveraged Python web scraping frameworks, including <b>Scrap.py</b>, and additional <b>JavaScript</b> scripting to manage data processing and server-side operations. Our choice of database management was <b>MongoDB</b>, a robust and flexible platform which caters to our data storage needs. Other node libraries we used were <b>axios</b>, <b>nodemailer</b>, <b>cors</b>, and <b>EJS</b>. We used the OpenAI package which provided access to <b>OpenAI</b> language models and services.

To ensure reliable and efficient hosting for our application, we chose <b>Qoddi</b>, a web application hosting provider known for its performance and scalability. These technologies afford us the ability to deliver a high-quality educational support application to our users.

<h1>Our AI experience</h1>
<p>A.)Yes we used AI to help create our app. We leveraged tools like ChatGPT to analyze our other team members code for example so we could better understand it to work on it. We also used ChatGPT to assist us in creating functions which were simple but tedious and verbose to create. We also used tools like DALL-E which is an AI image generator to generate all of the images for the app.</p>

<p>B.)We did not use AI to create or clean data sets.</p>

<p>C.)Our app actually utilizes AI aswell! We implemented the OpenAI API to use the GPT model for our online tutoring bot. This GPT bot is able to generate customized learning plans for students based on their inputs and learning style. It also saves chat history and will remember the user similar to ChatGPT! </p>

<p>D.)A limitation we encountered was DALL-E not having enough tokens for all of the pictures we had to generate and the only other option was to pay. We overcame this by using apps that utilize DALL-E to create images for free such as NightCafe. Another limitation we encoutered was ChatGPT's use during hours of peak use, the way we overcame this was by often taking a break during these peak hours and resuming work after so we could work more efficiently and not be stucking waiting for servers to be availible again or speeds to get back to normal.</p>
