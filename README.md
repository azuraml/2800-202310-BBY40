<h1>Technologies</h1>
<p>In the development of SuccessWeb, we used a range of technologies to ensure a seamless and efficient user experience. For the front-end design, we utilized JavaScript, EJS, HTML, and CSS, and DALL-E for images creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

On the back-end, we leveraged Python web scraping frameworks, including Scrap.py, and additional JavaScript scripting to manage data processing and server-side operations. Our choice of database management was MongoDB, a robust and flexible platform which caters to our data storage needs. Other node libraries we used were axios, nodemailer, cors and EJS. We used the OpenAI package which provided access to OpenAl'S language models and services.

To ensure reliable and efficient hosting for our application, we chose Qoddi, a web application hosting provider known for its performance and scalability. These technologies afford us the ability to deliver a high-quality educational support application to our users.
